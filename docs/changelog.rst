Version 1.16.0 (10 Dec 2020)
============================

Note: this is the first release since forking from kyuupichan/electrumx.
kyuupichan has the :code:`electrumx` name on PyPI, so we needed a new name there.
We are using the `e-x <https://pypi.org/project/e-x/>`_ name on PyPI, so you can
install this package via e.g. :code:`pip install e-x`.

* security: a vulnerability has been fixed that allowed a remote attacker to
  crash electrumx if peer discovery was enabled (`#22`_)
* fixed some peer-discovery-related bugs (e.g. `#35`_)
* ENV: when using Bitcoin, the COIN ENV var can now be set to :code:`Bitcoin`.
  For compatibility, using :code:`BitcoinSegwit` will also keep working.
  (`#5`_)
* session resource limits: made more useful in general. connection-time-based
  grouping has been removed (`#70`_). Disconnects of over-limit sessions happen
  sooner (`4b3f6510`_). Subnet sizes for IP-based grouping can now be
  configured (`a61136c5`_).
* protocol: :code:`mempool.get_fee_histogram` now returns fee rates with
  0.1 sat/byte resolution instead of 1 sat/byte, and the compact histogram
  is calculated differently. (`#67`_)
* performance: bitcoind is now queried less frequently as estimatefee,
  relayfee, and server.banner requests are now cached (`#24`_)
* performance: json ser/deser is now abstracted away and the :code:`ujson` and
  :code:`rapidjson` exras can be used for somewhat faster block processing.
  (`#11`_)
* multiple other small performance improvements
